Thanks for choosing ZCrypt !
This software was developped by Clement and has been released the 24th of February 2020

ZCrypt is a progam that uses Python engine to run
Please, take into consideration that, all the files linked to this app or which were created by this app will be saved in the same location that the software
So, if you want to decrypt a message, please paste the file you want to decrypt in the software's location

Crypting Engine :
Now Let's talk a bit about cryptography...
Here is how ZCrypt encrypting engine works
When you type, your message, ZCrypt make an analysis of each character
After that, he assigns to each character its corresponding Ascii number and changes this number by adding or removing another number : the key !
The program deicdes to add or remove a number considering one more time the key : if the key is a pair number, it removes the key from the original Ascii but if the key is an impair number, it adds the key to the Ascii code of the character
After that, ZCrypt splits the final encrypted ascii in three number (eg : 126; 093; 105...) and for each character of this Ascii number, it transforms it in its binary version
At the end, we get three binary codes (3 * 8) so a total lenght of 24 numbers
Recap, let's take an example your message is "a" : a ==> 97 ==> 97 + 25(key) ==> 122 ==> 00000001 (binary of 1) 00000010 (binary of 2) 00000010 (binary of 2)

Command usage :
You can type different commands to use ZCrypt
Here are they : encrypt, decrypt, settings, instructions, showErrors and manual

When you want to encrypt a message, type encrypt and press enter
Everything you need to do will be displayed
At the end, the file containing the encrypted message will be saved with a name as text file
This name is, by default, set to "Mail.txt" but you can change it in the settings

When you decrypt a message, everything is very simple
You just need to type decrypt
After that, ZCrypt will ask you to enter the name of the file you want to decrypt
Finally, all informations about the message will be displayed
These informations are : the date the message was created/wrote; the sender; the reciever and finally the message

ZCrypt offers to the user a settings page
In this part of the software, only 3 commands are allowed : see, set and exit
Every option you can change has a number assigned to it (eg : 1; 2; 3...)

When you want to see the status (also called value) of a setting, type "see X" where X is the number of the setting you want to see
If you want to change this value, type "set X" where is X is one more time the number assigned to the setting you want to edit
If you want to go back to the software main page, type exit and will be able to encrypt or decrypt messages again
!!! Warning : Since the commands (enrypt or decrypt) are not registered in the settings, crypting or decrypting messages is not possible when you are in the settings

The instructions command explains very shortly and easily how the program works and how to use it
Please consider reading it if this is your first time using ZCrypt
If you need help, you can always read it
