# ZCrypt
## Features
* ZCrypt is a user-friendly interactive python program which can crypt a message along with the name of its sender and reciever
* ZCrypt can of course decrypt what was encrypted
* ZCrypt also offers a settings page which provides some customization such as changing date format, showing warnings...
* Use of a custom symmetric encryption algorithm (see [Manual](UserManual.md#cryptEng) for details)
* I will try to add support for crypting with RSA soon

Feel free to commit improvements and enjoy !
