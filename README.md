# ZCrypt
## Features
* ZCrypt is a user-friendly interactive python program which can crypt a message along with the name of its sender and reciever
* ZCrypt can of course decrypt what was encrypted
*  A settings page which offers some customization for the user such as changing date format, showing warnings...
* Custom symmetric encryption algorithm (see [Manual](UserManual.md) for details)
* I will try to add support for crypting with RSA soon

Feel free to commit improvements and enjoy !
