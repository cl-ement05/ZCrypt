# ZCrypt
## Features
* ZCrypt is a basic user-friendly interactive python program which can crypt a message along with the name of its sender and receiever
* ZCrypt can of course decrypt what was encrypted
*  A settings page which offers some customization for the user such as changing date format, showing warnings...
* Custom symmetric encryption algorithm (details in explained in [Manual](Beta/Manual.txt))
I will try to add support for crypting with RSA in next months
Feel free to commit improvements and enjoy !
